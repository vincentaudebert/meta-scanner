Small project I made for my own needs.

It's meant to work in local environment with a CORS plugin activated. Check `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on Google Chrome.

I released it on a github page here: https://vincentaudebert.github.io/meta-scanner

N.B.: It will work only on this domain for now. It's just here to give a quick idea of what this project is doing (especially data wise)

## Install

* Clone the repo
* Run `yarn install`
* Run `yarn start`

This is using `create-react-app`

## What's in there?

* React
* unstated
* react-accessible-accordion
* Formik
